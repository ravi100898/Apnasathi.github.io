    <p class="paragraph">‚ÄúOnce in a while, in the middle of an ordinary life, Love gives us a fairy tale‚Äù. Fortunately, apna sathi.com became a medium through which we could have this moment in our lives. It all started here when our profiles matched with each other and our parents started talking about meeting for the first time. When we first met, I still remember we both were scared, but after talking to each other we both had a sense that we have found a potential soulmate in each other. From the very first meeting, until today, we have never stopped talking, sharing, caring and laughing. After couple of meetings, date was fixed for us to get into a unbreakable bond for life on 20th December 2022. As they say, ‚ÄúA wedding is a start of togetherness of walks in the rain, basking in the sunshine, shared meals, caring for one another and sensing the love that a marriage carries.‚Äù Though this is an arranged marriage, I felt that we knew each other from a quiet long time. Before I met her I never knew what it was like to be able to look at someone and smile for no reason. Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love. It‚Äôs so great to find that one special person you want to spend the rest of your life. We must say we got ‚Äù A FRUITFUL SHAADI KA LADDU FROM apna sathi.com. üôÇ</p>
