    <p class="paragraph">My search for my soulmate ended when I came across Ankita’s profile on apna sathi.com. Our story began on October 4, 2021 when Ankita accepted my interest. I was just lucky to be shortlisted, as she had received nearly 500 interests in just two days after registering on the website. We exchanged some emails and she soon agreed to share her contact. After talking over the phone for a few days, I thought she was quiet and subtle, whereas I’m the opposite. </p>
    <p class="paragraph">We finally decided to meet up and I must say, I completely fell for her. I’m located in patna and I was on my annual leave during those days, so I happened to meet her. Since, we belonged to the same caste, it wasn’t difficult for us to convince our parents. Also, I was sure about getting married to her after our first meeting but Ankita was a little hesitant and couldn’t make up her mind. She took a couple of days to revert back and from there things got serious pretty quickly. We spoke to our parents and they finalized our engagement.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">It was during this patch that we understood each other better, as we went out shopping together and got to spend more time with each other. We finally got engaged on March 12 ,2022.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">We want to thank <b>apna sathi.com </b> and the team for making this possible!</p>
