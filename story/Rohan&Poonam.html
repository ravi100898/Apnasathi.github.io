    <p class="paragraph">Every girl after a certain age is told by her family to think of marriage. I had completed my post graduation and had started working, when my family thought of my marriage. Since I had just started working, I wasn’t sure about marriage. But my family told me about some successful arranged marriages through some matrimonial sites, because I initially wasn’t very comfortable with the idea of finding a life partner online. Since my family insisted, I agreed to register on apna sathi.com in 2021. I would check my profile only over the weekends but one fine day I happened to come across Rohan’s profile. We started chatting online and then on the phone. We got to know each other quite well in a few months. Rohan soon planned a trip to Goa and we liked each other. We then got our families involved. Things worked out well and in February, 2014 we tied the knot. Even now, I sometiems feel like it was all a dream. I consider 2022 to be a lucky year for me, as I found Rohan. I really thank apna Sathi.com for helping me find Rohan. This wouldn’t have been possible without apna sathi.com</p>
