    <p class="paragraph">“My name is Satyam and I reside in Bihar. One day I came across the profile of a girl that really changed my life. I was so mesmerised by her beauty and that extreme charm of her face that I instantly sent invitation to connect with her. Thankfully, she also accepted my invitation and we began communicating with each other in no time. She had very similar taste as me in terms of living life and her personality, her energy, innocence, and cuteness just started making me realise that she is the one for me. I could talk to her on almost any topic and never get bored. After talking to each other though phone calls, social messaging, and video calls, I decided to see Chandni, in Bangalore where she works. My parents had already spoken to her on the Phone and via video calls so they all knew about her and were okay with me to see her in Bangalore. So after coming to Bangalore we got to know each other some more and we spent most beautiful time with each other even though, it was only for 6 days. After getting to know her, I proposed her for marriage on the night of June 6th, 2020 after candle light dinner and she readily agreed. After that we got our parents involved with each other and once they also gave the nod our marriage was fixed. We got married on December 8, 2020 in Surat, India. I would like to thank apna sathi.com for making a difference in our lives and for being a medium through which we were able to find each other.”</p>
