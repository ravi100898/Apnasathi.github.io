    <p class="paragraph">I had joined apna sathi.com in November of 2019 with not exactly knowing what to expect from the portal or for that matter the process of arranged marriage itself. What followed was a plethora of profiles, interests and matches for the day. It was on apna sathi.com in a mind-boggling set of choices that destiny played its will. Kritika sent me an interest on apna sathi.com in December and I accepted it. Soon her father happened to come to Mumbai and he met my family. My parents were happy and our families then decided to take things forward. Thus, planting the seeds of our love story</p>
    <p class="paragraph">People might have heard of love at first sight, for us it was a connection over the very first phone call that lasted over an hour without either of us realizing it. In just a couple of months of spending time together, we were sure that no matter what, we both want to share our life with each other. So on 12th January 2021 our families got together in Mumbai. This experience or process has re-affirmed my belief in destiny.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Marriages are made in heaven but apna sathi.com is the medium god is using these days. It surely found me my love!! <b>Thank you apna sathi.com!</b></p>
