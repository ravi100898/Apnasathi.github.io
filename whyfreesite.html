         <p class="paragraph">Melodramatic as it may sound, the people of Indian sub-continent still believe that relations are made in heaven and we agree with this sentiment and firmly believe that "Search for the bride or groom should not come with a price tag" so we "do not charge for anything at any stage" during entire matrimonial process on this web site</p>
